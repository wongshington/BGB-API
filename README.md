# BGB-API
The back-end service for the BGB app.

# SQLite
try `$ bundle exec rake...` if `$ rails...` doesn't work

`$ rails db:migrate`

`$ rails db:reset` 
(includes drop etc...)

`$rails db:seed`
(if just changing seeds.rb, instead of rails db:reset)

`$ rails db`
to access the SQLite command line. Commands take the form of SQL queries. Don't forget the semicolon;

`$^D`
to quit the SQL command line

## Resources
- id: integer 
- description: string
- distance: float
- hours: string
- phone: string
- resource: string
## Topics
- id: integer 
- Topic: string 

Each topic object can be referenced by underscore separated variable name. 
Since there is so few, I seeded them this way to access them easily.

EX: to access the topic for "Immediate Danger", use immediate_danger.

## Connectors
- resource_id: integer
- topic_id: integer

Can mainly ignore, just the work around for the many-to-many relation. 
Can create a connector using Connector.create(...) to add a new resource-topic connection using foreign keys resource_id and topic_id.

OR (easy) assign resouce_var_name.topics to list of topics or topic_var_name.resources etc.

# Endpoints

    - required information: `email`, `password`
    - upon signing in, the response includes a `uid`, `access-token`, `client`, and `expiry` that must be passed back and forth on EACH request to the API
